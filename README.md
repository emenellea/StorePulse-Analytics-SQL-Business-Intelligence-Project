# StorePulse-Analytics-SQL-Business-Intelligence-Project
 
📌 Project Overview
 
This project analyzes a structured commerce database to extract business insights related to revenue performance, customer behavior, and product trends using advanced SQL techniques.
The goal of this project is to simulate real-world data analysis tasks performed by data analysts in retail and e-commerce environments.

_ Database Schema :
The project is built using three relational tables:
1️/ Customers
•	customer_id (Primary Key)
•	name
•	city
•	join_date
2️/ Products
•	product_id (Primary Key)
•	product_name
•	category
•	price
3️/ Orders
•	order_id (Primary Key)
•	customer_id (Foreign Key)
•	product_id (Foreign Key)
•	quantity
•	order_date
The tables are linked through foreign key relationships between customers, products, and orders.

_ Business Questions Answered :
This project answers 24 business-oriented analytical questions including:
	What is the total store revenue?
/ Who are the top spending customers?
/ What is the customer lifetime value?
/	Which product categories generate the highest revenue?
/	What is the monthly revenue trend?
/	How does revenue grow month-over-month?
/	Which customers purchased all products in a category?
/	What are the sales decline periods?

_SQL Concepts Used:
This project demonstrates the use of:
	INNER JOIN / LEFT JOIN
/	GROUP BY and HAVING
/	Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
/	Subqueries
/	Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LAG)
/	PARTITION BY
/	Revenue growth calculations
